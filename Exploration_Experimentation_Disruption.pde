1. Briefly outline how youâ€™ve taken your work beyond in class exercises through exploration and experimentation 

As a Computer Science student, I am familiar with the fundamentals of different concepts in programming 
like primitive data types, scoping, invoking functions, and object-oriented programming. 
I would say that I was able to apply some advanced programming techniques in creating this drawing program project
that are beyond what was taught in class:

    A. 
    In order to achieve a clean and understandable code, I applied the principle of object-oriented programming in 
    this project. Instead of using primitive data types in defining brush stroke weight, opacity, color, and shape, I 
    defined a Brush class that could be instantiated and initialized with initial values of weight, opacity, color, and
    shape which are the properties of the brush object. I also defined brush object methods that is called depending
    on what the user intents to do with the brush like increasing or decreasing brush opacity or size
    and using the brush itself in the draw() function. Also, I defined a Button class in creating buttons on the palette bar.
    
    B. 
    In displaying the buttons, instead of manually creating button objects, I used a looping technique to iteratively
    lay out the buttons on the palette bar. This way, I don't have to manually calculate the positioning of each button 
    because there is already an algorithm the computes where to put the succeeding buttons.
    
    C. 
    I used array to store color elements that is eventually iterated through a for-loop to initialize color property
    of button objects.
    
    D. 
    I experimented using processing's built-in function cursor() to manipulate the look of the mouse pointer depending 
    on which element it hovers on. This made the drawing program more intuitive to use. 
    
    E. 
    I experimented using processing's built-in function save() to take a screenshot image of the program's window.
    Also, to enable the user to save multiple images without worrying about overwritting old image files, saved images are
    named based on the date/time it was saved.


2.  Briefly outline how your program disrupts or challenges our expectations or assumptions of what a drawing program is 
    or how it should operate 
    
    My drawing program offers a lot of brush settings. User can manipulate the color, shape, opacity, and size/weight.
    The user can also enable color randomization to create a multicolor brush strokes. The user can also enable mirroring so
    that two versions of the drawing is produced (the other version mirrors the original drawing).
